            <h2>Mock Stock</h2>
            <p>In a world, where simultaneously there exists the skeptics crediting all market movements to the ‘animal spirits’ of investors, and the ‘expertise’ of formally trained stock brokers, can a bunch of undergrads know the market well enough to predict how it moves? If you think you can, then this January we will be providing you the platform to prove your mettle, in an all new event in this edition of YESM.</p>
