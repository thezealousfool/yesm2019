    <h2>Paper Presentation</h2>
    <p>No matter what people tell you, words and ideas can change the world.</p>
    <p>But for good ideas to lead to great innovation and change, you need to present them to the people; make them argue and debate and finally bridge the gap between closed minds through careful dissection of ideas and solid presentation of facts.</p>
