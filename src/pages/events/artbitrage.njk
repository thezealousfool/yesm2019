    <h2>Poster making &amp; Doodling</h2>
    <p>&quot;Art speaks when words are unable to explain. After all, creativity is the greatest rebellion in existence.&quot;</p>
    <p>Who said you could only write a paper to present your ideas to the world? You could also splash some colours on a paper and make it speak a thousand words!Â This January, come, let your creativity explode!</p>
